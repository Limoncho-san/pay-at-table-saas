5. Business Model (SaaS Revenue Strategy)

Since we will have monthly operational costs, we need a sustainable revenue model. Our revenue will come from a percentage of each transaction processed via our service in addition to potential subscription fees.

Fee-Based Models for Revenue Generation

We have two options for implementing transaction fees:

A. Immediate Fee Deduction

The fee (e.g., 1.5%) is deducted automatically from each transaction before settling the funds to the restaurant.

Example:

Customer pays ‚Ç¨100

‚Ç¨1.50 (1.5% fee) is deducted

Restaurant receives ‚Ç¨98.50

‚úÖ Pros: Immediate revenue collection, no risk of unpaid fees.

‚ùå Cons: Restaurants might prefer to see full transactions first.

B. End-of-Month Billing

The platform tracks all transactions and calculates the total fees at the end of the billing cycle.

Restaurants receive an invoice for the total fees owed.

Example:

Restaurant processes ‚Ç¨10,000 in payments

Fee at 1.5% = ‚Ç¨150

Monthly invoice: ‚Ç¨150 due

‚úÖ Pros: Easier to manage for restaurants, avoids daily deductions.

‚ùå Cons: Risk of unpaid invoices, requires strong tracking.

6. Estimated Costs for Launching the SaaS
